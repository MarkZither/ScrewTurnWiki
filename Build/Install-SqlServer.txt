
Installing or Updating ScrewTurn Wiki
-------------------------------------

This document explains how to install or update ScrewTurn Wiki when using the 
SQL Server-based data providers.

INPUT_DIR refers to the WebApplication directory supplied along this file.
TARGET_DIR refers to the directory the application will live in on your server.

This document assumes that you have at least basic knowledge about managing a Windows Server
machine, IIS (Internet Information Services) and Microsoft SQL Server.

If you need help, you can ask questions in the project forum [1].

If you want to host ScrewTurn Wiki using a shared hosting service, or you don't have full 
administrative access to your server, please contact either the service's support or the 
server administrator.

Please also take a look at other installation packages that are available at the project 
website [2], which might better suit your needs.



Clean Installation
------------------

Note: depending on the environment you are running, the following steps might require 
minor adjustments.

 1. Create TARGET_DIR if it does not already exist; be sure that the directory is empty.

 2. Copy all the files from INPUT_DIR into TARGET_DIR.

 3. Open the "web.config" file with a text editor and set the MasterPassword field with a password
    that will be used for the built-in "admin" account, for example:
    <add key="MasterPassword" value="my_password_123" />

 4. In the "web.config" file, complete the SQL Server connection string, specifying server address, 
    database name and authentication information (either user/password or integrated authentication), 
    for example:
    <add key="SettingsStorageProviderConfig" value="Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=ScrewTurnWiki;User ID=wiki_user;Password=wiki_password_567;" />

 5. Make sure that the "web.config" file specifies the correct Settings Storage Provider:
    <add key="SettingsStorageProvider" value="ScrewTurn.Wiki.Plugins.SqlServer.SqlServerSettingsStorageProvider, SqlServerProviders.dll" />

 6. Create a database in SQL Server with the name specified in the connection string, making sure that 
    the specified user can create, alter and drop tables as well as select, update, insert and delete rows.
    Make sure that the database collation is NOT case sensitive.

 7. Setup a Web Site or Application in IIS, setting the root directory to TARGET_DIRECTORY.

 8. Navigate to the Web Site or Application using a web browser and verify that everything works properly 
    (the data providers, if the connection string is correct, will automatically create the required 
    tables in the database).

 9. Login using "admin" and the password you entered in the web.config file.


Updating From a Previous v3 Release
-----------------------------------

If you upgrading from v2, please refer to our online documentation [3].

Note: depending on the environment you are running, the following steps might require 
minor adjustments. If you made modifications to the application, the following steps 
might cause issues and make the application unusable and/or unstable.

 1. Navigate to TARGET_DIR and verify that the "public" directory only contains the "Plugins" directory.

 2. Backup all the content of TARGET_DIR (seriously).
    Backup your database (seriously).

 3. Rename "app_online.htm" to "app_offline.htm": this will take the application offline.

 4. Delete all the content of TARGET_DIR, ***except***:
    - "web.config" file
    - "app_offline.htm" file.

 5. Copy "SqlServerProviders.dll" from the distribution package into "TARGET_DIR\public\Plugins", 
    replacing the existing file.

 6. Select all files in INPUT_DIR, ***except***:
    - "web.config" file.

 7. Make sure your "web.config" file contains a "customErrors" section; if not, copy it from the default "web.config".

 8. Copy all the selected files into TARGET_DIR.

 9. Delete "app_offline.htm".

10. Navigate to the wiki using a web browser and verify that everything works properly, 
    (the data providers, if the connection string is correct, will automatically update the required 
    tables in the database).

11. Check for plugin updates in the administration interface.
