
Installing or Updating ScrewTurn Wiki
-------------------------------------

This document explains how to install or update ScrewTurn Wiki when using the built-in 
file-based data providers.

INPUT_DIR refers to the WebApplication directory supplied along this file.
TARGET_DIR refers to the directory the application will live in on your server.

This document assumes that you have at least basic knowledge about managing a Windows Server
machine and IIS (Internet Information Services).

If you need help, you can ask questions in the project forum [1].

If you want to host ScrewTurn Wiki using a shared hosting service, or you don't have full 
administrative access to your server, please contact either the service's support or the 
server administrator.

Please also take a look at other installation packages that are available at the project 
website [2], which might better suit your needs.



Clean Installation
------------------

Note: depending on the environment you are running, the following steps might require 
minor adjustments.

 1. Create TARGET_DIR if it does not already exist; be sure that the directory is empty.

 2. Copy all the files from INPUT_DIR into TARGET_DIR.

 3. Open the "web.config" file with a text editor and set the MasterPassword field with a password
    that will be used for the built-in "admin" account, for example:
    <add key="MasterPassword" value="my_password_123" />

 4. Set the permissions of the "public" directory so that the ASP.NET Worker Process has "Modify" 
    permissions on it (usually, the ASP.NET Worker Process runs as "NETWORK SERVICE" or "ASPNET", 
    depending on the Operating System version).

 5. Setup a Web Site or Application in IIS, setting the root directory to TARGET_DIRECTORY.

 6. Navigate to the Web Site or Application using a web browser and verify that everything works properly.

 7. Login using "admin" and the password you entered in the web.config file.


Updating From a Previous v3 Release
-----------------------------------

If you upgrading from v2, please refer to our online documentation [3].

Note: depending on the environment you are running, the following steps might require 
minor adjustments. If you made modifications to the application, the following steps 
might cause issues and make the application unusable and/or unstable.

 1. Navigate to TARGET_DIR.

 2. Backup all the content of TARGET_DIR (seriously).

 3. Rename "app_online.htm" to "app_offline.htm": this will take the application offline.

 4. Delete all the content of TARGET_DIR, ***except***:
    - "public" directory
    - "web.config" file
    - "app_offline.htm" file.

 5. Select all files in INPUT_DIR, ***except***:
    - "public" directory
    - "web.config" file.

 6. Make sure your "web.config" file contains a "customErrors" section; if not, copy it from the default "web.config".

 7. Copy all the selected files into TARGET_DIR.

 8. Delete "app_offline.htm".

 9. Navigate to the wiki using a web browser and verify that everything works properly.

10. Check for plugin updates in the administration interface.
